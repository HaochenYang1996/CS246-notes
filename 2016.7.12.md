Recall:
<pre><code>
void f() {
 myClass *p = new myClass;
 myClass mc;
 g(); //may throw
 delete p;
}

void f() {
 auto p = make_unique < myClass > ();  //type is unique-ptr < myClass >
 myClass mc;
 g();
}
</code></pre>

Difficulty:
<pre><code>
class c{...};
...
unique-ptr < c > p {new c{...}};
unique-ptr < c > q = p;
</code></pre>
What happens when a unique-ptr is copied? </br>
Same ptr is deleted twice. WE DONT WANT THIS. </br>
Instead, copyinG is disabled for unique-ptr, THEY CAN ONLY BE MOVED

###implementation
<pre><code>
template < template T > class unique-ptr {
 T *ptr;
 public:
  unique-ptr(T *p): ptr{p} {}
  ~unique-ptr() {delete ptr;}
  unique-ptr(const unique-ptr < T > &other) = delete;
  unique-ptr < T > &operator= (const unique-ptr < T > &other) = delete;
  unique-ptr(unique-ptr < T > &other): ptr{other.ptr} {other.ptr = nullptr;}
  unique-ptr < T > &operator= (const unique-ptr < T > &other) {
   using std::swap;
   swap(ptr, other.ptr);
   return *this;
  }
  T &operator*() {return *ptr;}
};
</code></pre>
If you need to be able to copy ptrs, use std::share-ptr
<pre><code>
void h() {
 auto p1 = make-shared < myClass > ();
 if (...) {
   auto p2 = p1;
 } // p2 popped. ptr is not deleted
} //p1 popped, ptr is deleted
</code></pre>

Shared-ptrs maintain a reference count, count of all </br>
shared-ptrs pointing at the same object </br>
Memory is freed when the last shared-ptr pointing at that object is destroyed 

use shared ptr and unique ptr instead of raw ptrs as much as possible </br>
Dramatically fewer opportunities for leaks

3 levels of exception safety for a function f:
- Basic guarantee: if an exception occurs, the program will be in a valid state,
nothing is leaked, class invariants maintains
- Strong guarantee: if an exception is raised while execution f, the state
 of the program will be a if f had not been called
- No-throw guarantee: f will never throw or propagale an exception and will 
always accomplish its task

Example:
<pre><code>
class A {...};
class B {...};
class C {
 A a;
 B b;
 void f() {
  a.method1(); //may throw(strong guarantee)
  b.method2(); //may throw(strong guarantee)
  }
};  
</code></pre>
Is c::f safe? </br>
if a.method1() throws, nothing has happened yet OK </br>
if b.method2() throws, effects of method1 must be undone to offer the strong guarantee </br>
very hard ir impossible if method1 has non-local side-effects </br>
SO NO, it is not exception safe

If A::method1 and B::method2 do not have non-local side-effects, we can use copy and swap

<pre><code>
class C {
 ...
 void f() {
  A atemp = a;
  B btemp = b;
  atemp.method1();
  btemp.method2(); //things above throw, original a and b stil intact
  a=atemp;
  b=btemp; //BUT what is copy assignment throws?
</code></pre>
Better if the swap at the end was no-throw </br>
NOTE: pointer swap never throw </br>
Copying ptrs never throw

SOLN: use the pImpl idiom: </br>
(for separate compilation and safe exception)
<pre><code>
struct CImpl {
 A a;
 B b;
};

class C {
 unique-ptr < CImpl > pImpl;
 void f() {
  auto temp = make-unique < CImpl > (*pImpl);
  temp->a.method1();
  temp->b.method2();
  std::swap(pImpl, temp); //NO throw
  }
};
</code></pre>
  
If A::method1 or B::method2 offer no exception safely guarantees, then neither can C::f

###Exception Safety and the STL Vectors
vectors: encapsulate a heap-allocated array </br>
RAII: when a stack-allocated vector goes out of scope, </br>
the interval heap-allocated array is freed
<pre><code>
void f() {
 vector < myClass > v;
 ...
} //v goes out of scope, array is freed, myClass dtor runs on all objects in the vector
</code></pre>
BUT 
<pre><code>
void g() {
 vector < myClass *> v;
 ...
}
</code></pre>
Array is freed, ptrs do not have dtors, so any objects pointed at by </br>
ptrs in v are NOT deleted </br>
v does not know whether the ptrs in the array own the objects they point at

BUT
<pre><code>
void h() {
 vector < shared-ptr < myClass > > v;
 ...
}
</code></pre>
Array is freed, shared ptr dtors run, so objects are delated if no other </br>
shared ptr points at them </br>
do not have to do any explicit deallocation

vector < T > : emplace_back </br>
offers strong guarantee </br>
if the array is full(i.e size == cap):
- allocate new memory
- copy the objects over (copy ctor)
(if copy ctor throws, it will destroy the new array and the old one is intact)
- delete the old array

But copying is expensive and the old data will be thrown away </br>
Would moving the objects be more efficient? </br>
- alloccate new array
- move the objects over (move ctor)
(if move ctor throws, cannot offer the strong guarantee and old array is not intact)
- delete the old array

emplace_back uses move ctor is it promises to be no throw </br>
else uses the copy ctor(slower)
<pre><code>
class myClass {
 public:
  myClass(myClass &&other) noexcept {...}
  myClass &operator=(myClass &&other) noexcept {...}
};
 </code></pre>
