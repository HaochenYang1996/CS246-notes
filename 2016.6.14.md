###Specialization and Centralization(inheritance)
Suppose you want to track your collection of books:
<pre><code>
class Book {
 string title, author;
 int NumPages;
 public:
 Book(...) {
  ...
  }
};
</code></pre>
For textbook, also want this topic:
<pre><code>
class Book {
 string title, author;
 int NumPages;
 string topic;
 public:
 Book(...) {
  ...
  }
};
</code></pre>
For comic books, wants the hero:
<pre><code>
class Book {
 string title, author;
 int NumPages;
 string hero;
 public:
 Book(...) {
  ...
  }
};
</code></pre>
This is OK, but does not capture the relationships among these classes </br>
And how do we create an array to other collection that contains the mixture of these? </br>
COULD: 
 - use an union
 <pre><code>
 union BookTypes{Book *b; Text *t; Comic *c;};
 Booktypes mybooks[20]; //not good solutions, subvert the type system
 </code></pre>
 
- use array of void *
Pointer observes: </br>
texts *comics are kinds of Books, Books ... </br>
to model in C++: inheritance
 <pre><code>
 Class Text: public Book {
  string topic;
  public:
   Text {...};
   };
   
   Class Comic: public Book {
    string hero;
    public:
    Comic {...};
    }
  int numPage;
</code></pre>

Derived classed inherit: fields and methods form the base classes </br>
so Text, Comic get title, author, numPages fields </br>
Any method that can be called on Book can be called on Text, Comic

Q: Who can see thses members? </br>
title, author, numPages. Private in Book, can Text, Comic see them? </br>
A: NO! even subclasses CANNOT see them.

Q: How do we initialize Text? </br>
A: Need title, author, numPages, topic to initialize the base part
 <pre><code>
 class Text: public Book {
  string topic;
  Text(string title, string author, int numPages, string topic) :{
   title{title}, author{author}, numPages{numPages}, topic{topic}} {}
   }; //THIS IS WRONG!!!
</code></pre>
Wrong for a reason:
- title,etc belong to Book, not Text
- Once again, when an object is created:
 1. space is allocated
 2. subclasses part is constructed(NEW)
 3. Field is constructed
 4. ctor body runs
And 2. does not work, because Book does not have default ctor

Fix: </br>
invoke Book's ctor in Text's MIL:
<pre><code> 
class Text public Book {
 string topic;
 public:
 Text(string title,string author, int numPages, string topic): 
 Book{title, author, numPages}, topic{topic} {}
 };
</code></pre>
If the subclasses has no default ctor, the subclasses MUST invoke a non-default superclass ctor in the MIL </br>
Good reasons to keep superclasses fields inaccessble to subclasses

If you want to give subclasses access to contain memebers:  </br>
Use protected access
<pre><code>
class Book {
protected:
string title, author; ///access to books and is subclasses
int numPages;
Public:
Book(...) {
 ...
 }
};

class Text:public Book {
 string topic;
 public:
 void addAuthor(string newAuthor) {author + newAuthor;}
 };
</code></pre>
Not a good idea to give subclasses unlimited access to fields </br>
Better:
make the fields private, not provide protected accessors
<pre><code>
class Book{
string title, author;
int numPages;
protected:
 string getTitle() const;
 void setAuthor(string newAuthor);
Public:
Book(...);
bool isItHeavy() const;
...
};
</code></pre>
Relationship among Book, Text, Comic, called "is a"
- a Text is a Book
- A Comic is a Book

In MIL:
<pre><code>
     Book
      |
  |       |
Text   Comic
</code></pre>


implement "is a" by public inheritance </br>
Now consider the method isItHeavy. When is a book heavy?
- for ordinary books, > 200 pages
- for Texts > 500 pages
- for Comics > 30 pages

<pre><code>
class Book {
...
public:
...
 bool isItHeavy()const {return numPages > 500;}
 }; 
 //comic is similar

Book b {"A small book", "Papa Smart", 50};
comic c {"A Big Comic", "...". 40, "..."};
  cout<<b.isItHeavy(); //false
      <<c.isItHeavy(); //true
</code></pre>

Now since public inheritance means "is a", we can do this: </br>
Book n = comic {"A big comic", ..., 40, ...};

Q: is b heavy? </br>
