How many times does word $1 appear in file $2?
#!bin/bash
x=0
for word in $(cat “$2”); do
if [$word = $1]; then 
  x=$((x+1))
fi
done
echo$x

e.g.:Payday is the last Friday of the month. When month is the pay day?
(2 tasks: find the date, format)
cal | awk '{print $6}'|egrep "[0-9]" | tail -1

function looks like: $fcnname(some output like the line above)

#!/bin/bash
answer() {  //inside a fcn, $1, $2 are args of the fcn;
if [$1 –eq  31]; then
echo “this month: the 31st”
else 
echo “this month: the ${1}th”
fi
}

Generalize to any month:
Cal june 16 -> gives the calendar for june 2016, so let june 2016 give june 2016;s payday

Answer ${ cal  $1 $2| awk '{print $6}'|egrep "[0-9]" | tail -1} ($1: month $2:year) NOTE: $1 and $2 will be blank/empty string if nothing was typed in, revert to the previous call of cal

So:
#!/bin/bash
answer() {
if [$2]; then
preamble  = $2;
else
preamble = “this month”
fi
if [$1 –eq  31]; then 
echo “${preamble}: the 31st”
else
 echo “${preamble}: this ${1}th”
fi 
}

TESTING:
-essential part of program development
-ongoing – NOT JUST AT THE END
-begin before you start coding
-test suites –expecting
IT IS NOT DEBUGGING
Cannot debug without first testing
Cannot guarantee correctness and can only prove wrongness
Ideally developer and tester are different person

-human testing
-machine testing

black/white/grey box testing –no/full/some knowledge of program implementation

start with black-box, supplement with white box
-	various classed of input
-	edge cases
-	corner cases
-	intuition/experience(guess likely errors)
-	-extreme cases
white box – execute all logical paths
         -make sure everything works

Performance testing – fast enough?
Regression resting – making sure that new changes to the program font break old test cases
-test suites, testing scripts, always add tests and never subtract them

Module 2: c++
Hello world in c:
#include<stdio.h>
int main() {
printf(“Hello world\n”);
return 0;
}

Hello world in c++:
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main(){
cout<<”Hello world”<<endl;
return 0;
}

NOTE: main must rerun int in c++
-stdio.h, printd still available in c++, but we prefer c++ i/o, which is <iostream>
output: std;;cout <<_<<_<<_...(“_” contains data)
std;;endl ->end of line
using namespace std-let you say cout/endl instead of std;;cout/std;;endl
return stmt – returns status code to shell($?)
if left out main returns 0;

Compiling c++ programs:
g++-5 –std=c++14 program.cc -o program(-o program: name of the executable binary, if left out, compiler will use a.out)
OR we can use: g++14 program.cc –o program

Input/output:
3 i/o streams: cout – for printing stdout
cin – for reading from stdin
cerr – for printing to stderr
i/o operators: << “put to” (output)
>> “get from” (input)
cerr<<x
cin>>x
NOTE: operators “points” in the direction of  information flow

E.g: adding two numbers:
#include<iostream>
using namespaces std;
int main(){
int x,y;
cin>>x>>y;
cout<<x+y<<endl;
}

NOTE: cin >> ignores white space
Cin>>x>>y gets two ints from stdin, skipping white space.
