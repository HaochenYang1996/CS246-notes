#Tutorial:
most common usage of string to numbers:
<pre><code>
int mum;
string test = ...
istringstream ss {test}
if (ss >> num) {
... //first was an int
} else {
...//first was not an int
}
</code></pre>

istringstream - allows only reading from strings </br>
ostringstream - can only be written to

###Filestreams:
ifstream - input filestream(cin) </br>
ofstream - output filestream </br>

###pointer and references:
..._<(^w^< ) </br>
<pre><code>
const int x = 42; //cannot change x
int y = 43; //can change y
const int *a = &x; //can change a's value but not x's throuth a
int *const b = &y; //cannot change b's value but can change y through b
const int *const c = &x; //cannot change anything
</code></pre>
