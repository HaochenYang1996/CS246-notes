Book *pb = &c;
Comic *pc = &c;
pc->isItHeavy(); //true
pb->isItHeavy(); //false
</code></pre>
Same object behaves differently, depending on what type of ptr points to it </br>
Compiler uses the type of the ptr(or ref) to decide whcih isItHeavy to run </br>
does not consider the actual type of the object

Means a Comic only acts as a Comic if a Comic ptr(or ref) points to it.

Q:How do we make a Comic act like a Comic, even when pointed ar by a Book ref? </br>
A: Dclare the method **virtual**.
<pre><code>
class Book {
 string title, author;
 protected:
  int numPages;
public:
  Book (...);
  virtual bool isItHeavy() const;
 };
 
 class Comic: public Book {
  ...
  public:
   bool isItHeavy() const override;
  };
  Comic c {...,...,40,...}

Book *pb = &c;
Book &rb = c;
Comic *pc = &c;
Book b = c;

pb->isItHeavy(); //true
rc-> isItHeavy(); //true
pc->itItHeavy(); //true
b.isItHeavy(); //FALSE
</code></pre>
virtual methods: choose which calss method to run based on the actual type of the object at runtime
<pre><code>
Book *myBooks[20];
...
for(int i = 0; i<20; ++i) {
 cout<<myBook[i]->isItHeavy9); << endl;
 } 
//uses Book;;isItHeavy() for Books
//     Text;;isiItHeavy() for Texts
//     Comic;;isItHeavy() for Comics
</code></pre>
Accommodates  multiple types under one obstraction - polymorphim </br>
Note: this is why a function void f(istream &in) can be passed an ifstream </br>
ifstream is a subclass of istream

DANGER:
<pre><code>
class one {
 int x,y;
 public:
  one(int x = 0; int y = 0): x{x},y{y} {}
  };
  
class Two:public one{
 int z;
 public:
  Two(int x = 0; int y = 0, int z = 0) : one{x,y}, z{z} {}
  };

voif f(one *a) {
 a[0] ={6,7};
 a[1] = {8,9};
 }
 
 Two myArray[] { {1,2,3}, {4,5,6} };
 f(myArray);
myArray | 1 2 3 | 4 5 6 | </br>
a[0] = {6,7}; </br>
a[1] = {8,9}; </br>
Data is mis aligned
</code></pre>

NEVER:
uses arrays of objects polymophically </br>
if you want a polymophic array, use an array of ptrs

###Dtor revisited:
<pre><code>
class x{
 int *x;
 public:
  x(int n): x {new int [n]} {}
  ~x() {delete[] x};
};

class y{
int *y;
public:
 y(int m, int n): x{n}, y {new int [m]} {}
 ~y() {delete[] y}
};

x *myX = new Y{5,10};
delete myX; //LEAKS!!! it calls ~x but ~y so only x is freed
</code></pre>

How can we ensure that deletion through a ptr to the superclass runs the subclass dtor? </br>
Declare the dtor virtual
<pre><code>
class x {
 ...
 public:
 virtual ~y() {delete[] x};
};
</code></pre>
ALWAYS: make the dtor virtual in classes that are meant to have subclasses </br>
even is the dtor does nothing

If a class is not meant to be subclassed, declare it **final**
<pre><code>
class Y final: public x{ 
 ...
};
</code></pre>

### Pure Virtual Methods and Abstract Classed
<pre><code>
class student {
protected:
 int numCourses;
 public:
  ...
  virtual int fees() const;
}; // 2 kinds of student: regular & coop

class Regular: public Student {
 public:
  int fees() const override; 
};

class Coop: public Student {
 int fees() const override;
};
</code></pre>
Q: What should we put for student::fees? </br>
A: Dont know. Because every student should be regular or coop </br>
can explicitly give student::fees NO implementation
<pre><code>
class Student {
 ...
 public:
  virtual int fees() const = 0; // the method has no implementaion
  // it is called a pure virtual method
};
</code></pre>
A class with a  pure virtual methos is called an abstract class and cannot be instantiated </br>
purpose: to orgnize subclasses

Subclasses of an abstract class are also abstract </br>
unless they implement all pure virtual methods

A non-abstract class is called **concrete**

abstract classes: class name in italics </br>

###Inheritance and Copy/Move:
<pre><code>
class Book {
 ...
 public:
  //Defien copy/move ctor, copy/move =
};

class Text: public Book {
string topic;
public: 
 //Does not define copy/move
};

Text t{ "algorithms", 500, "CS"};
Text t2 = t; // not copy ctor in Text, what happens?
</code></pre>
What happens: </br>
- calls Book 's copy ctor
- then goes field by field (i.e. default behavior) for the Text part
- same for other operations

To write your own operations: </br>
Text::Text(const Text&other): Book{other}, topic{other, topic) {} </br>
<pre><code>
Text &Text operator= (const Text &other) {
 Book::operator = (other);
 topic = other.topic;
 return *this;
}

Text::Text(Text &&other) : Book {std::move(other)}
      topic {std::move(other.topic)} {}
      
Text &Text::operator = (Text &&other) {
  Book:operator = (std::move (other));
  topic = std::move(other.topic);
  return *this;
};
//even though other "ptrs" at an rvalue other
//itseld is and lvalue(so is other topic)
//std::move(x) forces lvalue x to be treated as
//rvalue so that move operations run
</code></pre>
