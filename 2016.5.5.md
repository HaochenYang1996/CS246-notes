Pipes:make one program’s output(stdout) another program’s input(stdin) (“|”) </br>

Example: how many words occur in the first lines of sample.txt? </br>
Tools : head – n file  - first n lines  </br>
Wc  – counts the words </br> 
Wc – w  -just print words  </br> </br>

Example: </br>
 Suppose we have files words1.txt, words2.txt ... each have one word a line.  </br>
Want； a duplicate free list of all the words used in any of the files. </br>
Use: sort – to sort the lines </br>
Uniq –remove consecutive duplicate lines from file </br>
Cat words \*.txt| sort| uniq (words \*.txt: match any files starts with “words” and ends with “.txt”) </br> </br>

Q: is it possible to use the output of one program as a parameter to another? </br>
- Yes.  </br>
Example: echo “Today is $(date) and I am $(whoami)” </br>
The shell executes $(date) and $(whoami) and substitutes the results into the command line. </br> </br>

WARNING: echo ‘ Today is $(date) and I am $(whoami)’  </br> 
this will print the literal interpretation(the same as what you type in) NO SUBSTITION IS PERFORMED </br> </br>

Echo Double quotes and single quotes of file names will only print the input. </br>
Echo “\”\*filename.txt\”” will print filenames with double quotes. </br>
Echo “$(ls filename \*. txt)” will list all the matching files. </br> </br>

Pattern matching in text files: </br>
Egrep(extended global regular extension print) = grep – E </br>
Egrep pattern file – return all lines that contain the pattern </br>
Example: egrep cs246 filename.txt </br>
        Egrep “cs245 | cs246” filename.txt ( “|” stands for “or”) </br>
NOTE: double quotes are used here to prevent shell evaluate “|” as a pipe. </br> </br>

The patterns that egrep understands are called regular expressions </br>
WARNING: Regular expressions are not globbing patterns </br> </br>

Echo “(c|C)(s|S)246” = Echo “cs246&Cs246” = echo “[cC][sS]246” </br>
“[...]” syntax says to match any SINGLE character in the square brackets. </br>
“[^...]” matches any one char that is not in the square brackets. </br> </br>

“?” syntax says to match 0 or 1 occurances of the preceding expression(such as white space) </br> </br>

(cs) \*246 will match 246, cs246, cscs246, cssss246,etc </br> 
cs(cs)\*246 matches at least one cs at the front </br>
(cs)+246 matches 1 or more preceding expression </br>
“.” Match any single character </br>
“.\*” will match any  sequence of chars. </br>
“.+” will match any non empty sequence of characters </br>
Example: “cs.+246” match any string starting with cs followed by any string, followed by 246. </br> </br>

“^” matches the beginning of the line </br>
“$” matches the end of the line. </br> </br>

Q: want all lines of even length? </br>
^(..)*$
