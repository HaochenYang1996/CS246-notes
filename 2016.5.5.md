Pipes – make one program’s output(stdout) another program’s input(stdin) (“|”)  </br>  </br>  

Example: how many words occur in the first lines of sample.txt? </br>  
Tools : head – n file  - first n lines  </br>  
Wc  – counts the words </br>  
Wc – w  -just print words </br>  
Example:
 Suppose we have files words1.txt, words2.txt ... each have one word a line. 
Want； a duplicate free list of all the words used in any of the files.
Use: sort – to sort the lines
Uniq –remove consecutive duplicate lines from file
Cat words *.txt| sort| uniq (words *.txt: match any files starts with “words” and ends with “.txt”)

Q: is it possible to use the output of one program as a parameter to another?
- Yes. 
Example: echo “Today is $(date) and I am $(whoami)”
The shell executes $(date) and $(whoami) and substitutes the results into the command line.

WARNING: echo ‘ Today is $(date) and I am $(whoami)’ -> this will print the literal interpretation(the same as what you type in) NO SUBSTITION IS PERFORMED

Echo Double quotes and single quotes of file names will only print the input.
Echo “\”*filename.txt\”” will print filenames with double quotes.
Echo “$(ls filename *. txt)” will list all the matching files.

Pattern matching in text files:
Egrep(extended global regular extension print) = grep – E
Egrep pattern file – return all lines that contain the pattern
Example: egrep cs246 filename.txt
        Egrep “cs245 | cs246” filename.txt ( “|” stands for “or”)
NOTE: double quotes are used here to prevent shell evaluate “|” as a pipe.

The patterns that egrep understands are called regular expressions
WARNING: Regular expressions are not globbing patterns

Echo “(c|C)(s|S)246” = Echo “cs246&Cs246” = echo “[cC][sS]246”
“[...]” syntax says to match any SINGLE character in the square brackets.
“[^...]” matches any one char that is not in the square brackets.

“?” syntax says to match 0 or 1 occurances of the preceding expression(such as white space)

(cs) *246 will match 246, cs246, cscs246, cssss246,etc
cs(cs)*246 matches at least one cs at the front
(cs)+246 matches 1 or more preceding expression
“.” Match any single character
“.*” will match any  sequence of chars.
“.+” will match any non empty sequence of characters
Example: “cs.+246” match any string starting with cs followed by any string, followed by 246.

“^” matches the beginning of the line
“$” matches the end of the line.

Q: want all lines of even length?
^(..)*$
