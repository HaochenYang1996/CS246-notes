Print all words in the global dict that start with e and have 5 chars:
Egrep “e ....$”

Ls –l  -> long form listing
Format: -rw-r—r—1 y77cao y77cao 25 sep 9 15:27 abc.txt
⬇   ⬇    ⬇   ⬇      ⬇   ⬇      ⬇       ↘
  type permision lines name group size   last modified date name

groups -> a user can be long to one or more groups 
type - -ordinary file
d directory
permissions 3 groups of 3 bits: rw-x rw-x rw-x(user bits , group bits, other bits)
User bits: apply to the files owner
Group bits: apply to members od the file’s group(other than the owner)
Other bits: apply to everyone else 

R: read bits
W: write bits
X: execute bits

bit	Meaning for ordinary files	Meaning for dir
R	File contents can be read	Dir’s contents can be read
W	Files content can be modified 	Dir’s contents can be modified(add, remove, etc)
x	Files can be executed as a program	Dirs. Can be navigated (can use cd)
If dir’s x bit is not set-> no access al all to the directory, nor to any files within it, nor to any subdirs.

Changing permissions: chmod [mode] [file]
Format&mote:
User type: u – user(owner)  g –group   o – other   a - all 
Operator: + -> add permission  - -> subtract permission  = -> set permission exactly
Permissions: r w x
e.g : give others read permission chmod o+r file
make everyone’s permmsion rx: chmod a = rx file
give the owner full control: u = rwx, u+rwx
owners can change permisions

shell scripts:
files containing sequences of shell commands, executed as programs
e.g.: print date, current user, current dir

#! /bin/bash
date 
whoami 
pwd
⬇
myscript
“shebang” line execute this file as a bash script
run the script: ./myscript

x=1(NO SPACES)  -> STRING “1”
echo $x
⇒	will get x as value 1

NOTE: USE $when fetching the value of a variable
- no $ when setting a car (“$” – fetch the values of ) 
good practice: ${x}

ALL VARIABLES CONTAINS STRINGS.

Dir = ~/cs246
Echo ${dir}
/usr/y77cao/cs246
ls $ {dir} -> shows contents of /usr/y77cao/cs246

Some global vars:
PATH – list of dirs.
-	when you type a command, shell searches these dirs. In order for a program with their name

echo * ->prints all files in the dir
echo “*” or echo ‘*’ prints a “*”

echo “$PATH” -> prints the path
echo ‘$PATH’ prints $PATH
$ expansion happens in double quotes but not in single quotes

Special vars for scripts:
$1, $2,... command line arguments 

E.g: check wether a word is in the dir ./ isITAWord hello
Egrep “^$1$” /usr/share/dict/words
⇒	prints the word when it is found, otherwise not 

a god password should not be in the dictionary

#!/bin/bash
egrep “^$1$” /usr/share/dict/words > dev/null -> suppress output
Note: every program returns a status code whtn finished(0 is found, 1 is not found)
$? = status of the most recently returned command

if[$? –eq 0]; then 
 echo bad password
else
 echo good password
fi

Verify the number of arguments:
#!/bin/bash
usage() { echo “usage: $0 password”} ($0: name of the script)

if [$#(number of arguments) -ne 1]; then 
usage
exit 1
fi

egrep as before

format:
if [cond] ; then
...
elif[cond]; then
...
else ...
fi

Loops- print numbers form 1 to $1
#!/bin/bash
while[$x –le $1]; do
echo $x
x = $((x+1)) -> “$((...))”for arithmetic
done

Looping over a list:
 e.g: rename all .cpp. to .cc
#!/bin/bash
for name in *.cpp; do
mv ${name}  ${name%cpp}cc
done

->for..in sets var to each word in the given list

How many times does word $1 occur in file $2

#!/bin/bash
x=0
dor word in $(cat “$2”); do
