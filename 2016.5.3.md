#Module 1: Linux shell
##2016.5.3
Shell: interface to the OS and get the OS to do things.
 E.g run programs, manage files
- graphical (clicking with mouth/touching with fingers )
- command line – type the command at a prompt(more versatile)
this course: bash (command line)

Note: Make sure using bash </br>
      Log in + type echo $0

Working with files:</br>
cat – displays the contents of files </br>
e.g cat /usr/share/dict/words 

Note: in linux, a dir is considered a special kind of file

ctrl-c to stop(^c) </br>
ls: list files in the current directory(get the non-hidden files) </br>
ls –a: –all files(including hidden ones) </br>
pwd- prints current dir </br>

Note:hidden files start with “ . ” (dot)

Q: type cat without anything？</br>
A: Nothing happens. It is waiting for input. And then it prints what ever you type. </br>
Might be useful if we could capture the output in a file.

cat > output.txt : dispalys the contents of output.txt </br>

Note: ^c will kill the program </br>
To stop: ^d at the beginning of the line send an EOF signal to cat (USE THIS)

In general: </br>
command args > :	file executes command args + capturing the output in file instead 
of sending to screen </br>
It is called output redirection. </br>
can also redirect input: cat < input.txt. It will take its input from input.txt instead of the keyboard and displays the comtent of input.txt.

Q: what is the difference? </br>
Cat input.txt: passes the name input.txt as and argument to cat. </br>
Cat opens the file and displys its contents

Cat < input.txt : the shell opens the file and passes its contents to cat in place of keyboard input

Also: cat * . txt (*: globbing pattern) </br>
* : match any sequence of characters. Shell finds all files in the current dir that match the </br>
    pattern and substitutes them onto the command line.</br>
cat a.txt b.txt c.txt: cat opens all of them and display them all.

Cat < *.txt (ERROR): shell will only attach one file to cat’s input stream

More globbing patterns please see the linux sheet </br>
Many commands accept both forms of input

Q: Can do both input and output redirection?</br>
A: Cat < input.txt  > output.txt </br>It will send chars from input.txt to output.txt(copying the file).

Every process is attached to 3 streams:</br>
Stdin-> program -> stderr or  -> stdout 

by default, stdin = keyboard, </br>
          stderr, stdout = screen
          
"<"  connects stdin to a file </br>
">"  connects stdout to a file </br>
"2>"  connects stderr to a file

stderr: separate output stream for error messages, so that output and error msgs to go to different places. </br>
         So that error msgs don't clutter output files or corrupt formatting </br>
Also: stdout may be buffered- system may wait to accumulate output before acturally displaying(flushing) it. </br>
      Stderr is never buffered – you get the error msgs immediately
