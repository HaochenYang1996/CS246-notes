Always: put \#include guards in .h files </br>
Never: put using namespace std in header files </br>
the using directive will be forces upon any client that includes the file </br>
so always use std;;in header files </br>

######NEVER INCLUDE .CC FILES!!!
######NEVER COMPILE .H FILES!!!

###Classes:
can put functions inside structs </br>
e.g:
<pre><code>
 struct student {
 int assgs,mt,final;
 float grade(){
 return assns * 0.4 + mt * 0.2 + final * 0.4;
 }
 }
 
 student s{60,70,80}
 cout << s.grade() << endl;
</code></pre>

class: essnetially a struct type that can contain functions. </br>
C++ has a class keyword that we will use it later

object: an instance of a class </br>
function grade: called a number function(or method)

Q: What does assns, mt, final mean inside of grade() {...}? </br>
A: they are fields of the current object, on which the method was invoked. </br>
Formally, methods takes a hidden extra parameter called *this* </br>
*this*: the pointer to the pbject on with the method was invoked </br>
e.g: 
<pre><code>
billy.grade(); //this = &billy, so we can write:
struct student{
...
float grade() {
return this->assns * 0.4 + this->mt * 0.2 + this->final * 0.4;
}
}
</code></pre>

###Initialization Objects:
<pre><code>
struct student{60,70,80}; //oK, but limited
</code></pre>
Better: include a method that does initialization -> constructor(cter)
<pre><code>
struct student() {
int assns,mt,final;
float grade() {
...
}
student(int assns,int mt, int final) {
  this->assns = assns;
  this->mt = mt;
  this->final = final;
 }
}

student billy{60,70,80}; //is now better
//if a co=tor is defined, these are passes as arguments to the stor
//if no ctor has been defined, these initialize the individual field of student
//OR:
student billy = student{60,70,80};
</code></pre>

####Uniform initialization:
<pre><code>
string s = "hello";
string s ("hello);

int x = 5;
int x(5);

string s {"hello"};
int s{5};
</code></pre>

###Heap allocation:
<pre><code>
student *billy = new Student{60,70,80};
</code></pre>
Adevantages of ctors: default parameters, overloading, sanity checks

<pre><code>
struct student() {
int assns,mt,final;
float grade() {
...
}
student(int assns = 0,int mt = 0, int final = 0) {
  this->assns = assns;
  this->mt = mt;
  this->final = final;
 }
}

atudent jane{70,80} // this means 70, 80, 0
student newkid; //0,0,0
</code></pre>

Note: Every class comes with a default(i.e. zero argument) ctor, which just </br>
default constructs any fields that are objects
e.g:
<pre><code>
vec v; //default ctor does nothing in this case
</code></pre>
but the built-in ctor goes away if you provide any ctor
<pre><code>
struct vec{
int x,y;
vec(int x. int y) {
this->x = x;
this->y = y}
}

vec v; //ERROR
vec v{1,2}; //OK

Q:What if a struct contains constants or references?
<pre><code>
int z;
struct MyStruct{
const int myconst = 5;
int &myref = z; //these have to be initialized
}
</code></pre>

Q: But does every instance of MyStruct need to have the same value of my const?
e.g:
<pre><code>
struct student() {
const int id; //const does not change, but not the same for all students
}
</code></pre>

Q: Where do we initialize?ctor body? </br>
A: Too late. the fields must be fully constructed before then

Q: What happens when an object is constructed?
A: - space is allocated
   - fields are constructed //need to put our initialization here
   - ctor body runs
How? </br>
-> Memeber initializtion list(MIL)
<pre><code>
struct student{
const int id;
student(int id, int assns, int mt, int final): //field{parameters}
id{id}, assns{assns}, mt{mt}, final{final}
{...}
};
</code></pre>
Note: you can initialize any field this way, not just consts </br>
Note: Fields are initialized in the order in which they were declared in the struct, even if the MIL orders them differently </br>
Note: MIL sometimes more efficient than setting field in its body

######EMBRACE THE MTL!

Q: what id a field is initialized inline and in MTL?
A: MIL takes precedence
e.g:
<pre><code>
Struct vec{
int x = 0; int y = 0;
vec(int x): x {x} {}
};
</code></pre>

Now consider:
<pre><code>
student billy{60,70,80};
student bobby {billy}; 
//how does this initializtion happen?
//the copy ctor for constructing one object as a copy of another
</code></pre>
Note: </br>
Every class comes with:
- default ctor
- a copy ctor(just copy all fields)
- a copy assignment operator
- a destructor
- a move ctor
- a move assignment operator

Building your own copy ctor:
<pre><code>
struct student{
...
}
</code></pre>
