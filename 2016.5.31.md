When is the bulit-in type ctor not correct? </br>
Consider:
<pre><code>
struct Note {
int data;
Node *next;
Node (int d, Node *n) : ... {}
}

Node *n = new Node{1, new Node { 2, new Node {3. nullptr}}}
Node m =*n; //copy ctor
Node *p = new Node{*n};
</code></pre>
simple copy of fields -> only the first node actually copied(shallow copy) </br>
If you want a deep copy(copy the whole list), you must have yor own copy ctor
<pre><code>
struct Node {
...
Node(const Node &other):
data{other.data},
next { other.next? new.Node {*other.next}:nullptr} {} //recursively copies the rest of the list
};
</code></pre>
The copy ctor is called:
1. when an object is initialized with another object(same class)
2. when and object is passed by value
3. when an object is returned bt a function
There are exceptions for all 3

Note: careful with ctors that can take ONE argument
Eg. 
<pre><code>
struct Node {
Node(int d),data{d),next{nullptr} {}
...
};
}
Node n(4);
Node n{4};

int f(Node n) {...}
f(4); //this works -> 4 implicitly constructed to node
</code></pre>
Danger: accidentially pass an int to a functoin expecting a Node </br>
Compiler does not signal and error </br>
potential errors not caught </br>
**Good Idea:** disable the implicit conversion, make the ctor explicit
<pre><code>
struct Node {
...
explicit Node(int d): data{d}, next{nullptr} {}
};

Node n(4);
Node n{4}; //OK

Node n = 4;
f(4); //NOT OK
}
</code></pre>

###Destructors:
when an object is destroyed(stack-allocated:goes out of the scope /heap-allocated: is deleted) </br>
a method called destructor(dtor) runs </br>
Specifically:
1. dtor body runs
2. fields dtors called in reverse declaraton order
3. space deallocated

Classes come with a dtor(just calls dtors for all fields that are objects)

When do we need to write our own?
Node *np = new Node{1, new Node {2, new Node { 3, nullptr}}} </br>
If np pass out if scope, the pointer is reclained(it was on the stack) and the list is leaked

If we say delete np, it calls *np's dtor

Write a dtor to ensure that the whole list is freed
<pre><code>
struct Node {
...
~Node() {delete nect;} //recursively calls *next's dtor until the whole list is deacllocated
}
</code></pre>

###copy assignment operator:
<pre><code>
student billy {60,70,80};
student jane{billy}; //copy ctor
student joey; //default ctor
joey = billy; //copy, but not construction
// "=": copy assignment operator uses complier supplied default
//May need to write your own
</code></pre>

<pre><code>
struct Node {
...
Node &operator = (const Node &other) { 
 data = other.data;
 delete next;
 next = other.next? new Node{*other.next} : nullptr;
 return this;
 } //dangerous
}
</code></pre>
Why? </br>
Node n {1, new Node {2, new Node {3, nullptr}}}; </br>
 n = n; // deletes n, then trie to copy n to n, undefined behavior
 
 Whwn writing operators, always watch the self assignment
 <pre><code>
 &operator = (const Node &other) {
 if (this == &other) return *this;
  data = other.data;
  delete next;
 next = other.next? new Node{*other.next}: nullptr;
 return *this;
 }
</code></pre>

Better:
<pre><code>
Node &operator = (const Node &other) {
 if (this == &other) return *this; //optional
 Node *temp = next; 
 next = other.next? new Node{*other.next}: nullptr;
 data = other.data;
 delete temp;
 return *this; //works even if other others is in my list
 //if new a=fails, node will stil be a valid state
</code></pre>

Alternative: copy-and-swap idiom
<pre><code>
\#include <utility>
struct Node {
...
void swap(Node &other) { 
using std;;swap;
swap(data, other.data);
swap(next,other.next);
}

Node &operator(const Node &other) {
Node temp = other; //copy other
swap(temp); //swap with my old data
return *this; //temp deallocated, frees my old data
}
</code></pre>

###RValues and Rvalue references
recall and lvalue is anyting with an address </br>
an lvalue reference always initialed by an lvalue

Now consider:
<pre><code>
Node *n = new Node{1, new Node { 2, new Node {3. nullptr}}};
Node m = n; //copy ctor
Node m2;
m2 = n; //copy assignment operator

Node plusOne(Node n) {
for(Node *p = &n;p;p = p->next) {
 ++p->data;
 }
 return n;
 }
 
 m3 = plusOne(n); //what runs? ->copy ctor
 //What is other here? 
 //-> the compiler creates a temperary object to hold the result od plusOne, so other has someting to point at
 //->copy ctor deep-copies data from the temp object

</code></pre>
